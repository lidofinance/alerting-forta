# Lido Detection Linea Bot

How does it work.

The bot works on two networks: ETH mainnet and Linea.
Here's how it operates: The bot monitors new blocks on the ETH mainnet.
Since Forta doesn't currently support Linea, the bot reads blocks on the L2 network (Linea) and stores the latest one
in an in-memory cache.
When the bot reads the next block on ETH, it also retrieves a segment of Linea blocks (cachedBlock, LatestBlock) from
the cache.

## Supported chains

- Ethereum mainnet, Linea network
